1. Keep code modules as separate as possible . Go for reusability only once you have verified that you are repeating yourself. 

2. Partitioning is the key when creating any data model . 

3. Always have a testing module ready . 

4. Test for a small dataset first or one record and then check the record count for whole dataset.Else it will result in wastage of time.  

5. Point 4 is not an excuse for whole dataset testing. 

6. Always try a combination of things before making any judgement. There is no right or wrong answer. Situation is different for each scenario.
